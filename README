To get the app up and running, there are a few prerequisites
First, set up a python virtual environment using
	python -m venv [name_venv]
Next activate the environment we just created,
	source [name_venv] [name_venv]/bin/activate
Next we need to install the dependencies required for the app to function,
which is listed in the requirements.txt file. 
Install them using pip3

These next steps are the most crucial and need to be done each time in each new terminal shell.
We need to set up the environment variables for Flask to be able to identify the app

	export FLASK_APP=app.py
	export FLASK_ENV=development

That's it. We're all set!
